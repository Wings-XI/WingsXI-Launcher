# Wings Renamer

Thank you to TeoTwawki & atom0s for creating the renamer addon.

## How to change "NPC" mob names


1. Navigate to your \Ashita\addons folder and add a new folder named 'renamer'.

2. Copy the Renamer plugin to the renamer folder that you just made

3. Create another folder inside the 'renamer' folder and name it 'lists'

4. Download the file "wings" and copy it into the 'lists' folder

5. Inside your default script \Ashita\scripts\Default.txt and add the following lines listed below.
```
/addon load renamer
/renamer load wings
```


**NOTE: This is a first run-through of any NPC named mobs, specifically in Dynamis. There may and will likely be mobs that I have missed, I will continue to add IDs to this list as we discover them.**
